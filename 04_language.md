    What is the language?

JavaScript

    How does one write & run code in this language?
    
JavaScript is a client-side language so your script or code can be written in any text editor saved as an .html file and run on any browser with JavaScript enabled. However, there are several on and offline enviroments such as Microsoft Makecode, P5 to name 2 that allow you to to write and run code within the enviroment. 
    
    Rate the complexity of the syntax?
    
I believe this question is dependent on other languages and audience. For many adults learning to code, JavaScript is their first language. I think that speaks to its reletive ease. If you do not find curly braces an issue, then it should not seem too complex. I find it just as, if not slightly easier than python, less complex than other C like languages than Java or C. It is more complex than block-based languages.
    
    Strengths
 
It is a client-side language. There are many fun enviroments to "play" in including many educational ones. For students, it is a great text-based language to get their feet wet in. There are many real-world applications that are easily accessed from functioning web apps to games. The C-like language syntax will allow students to transition easily into other more robust OOP languages. 
    
    How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
    
I really like Microsoft Makecode. It allows a seemles transition between block-based and JavaScript. For Students who are having trouble typing the code, this provides a built-in scaffold, where they can use a block if they need it, and the code will appear on the JS side. The reverse is also true, which I need because I get frustrated trying to find the block I am looking for so I just type the code and the block appears on the block side. I would love to do pyhsical computing with the micro:bit simulator (or even better the real device), which is all free from microbit.org or from Microsoft. There is a game design makecode and a minecraft as well others that i think would make for engaging programming exercises, while giving students who have used blocks that extra bit (pun intended) of support. The syntax similarity to other languages also will allow me to introduce other languages in my class. 
   
    Weaknesses
It is a clint-side language is also a weakness, but for this assignment, the problems with JS as a whole is not the question at hand, but rather the weakness as a language for teaching. The biggest weakness is the weakness of most languages is that it is text based. Learning programming can be difficult for most and typing can add an extra layer of difficulty to the learning process
    
    How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
 
As mentioned above, choosing an online enviroment that provides support for students who will have difficulty with the typing. I will still encourage typing, and show them the benefits, but they will have that as an aid.
    
    Why did you select this language for this class?
 
I have been wanting to learn JS for a few years now since I wanted to teach. I started to play with the BBC micro:bit device and used JS and Python to code with it. I realized I liked JS alot as a beginning language. When I took Methods II last Spring 2022, I was inpressed with some of my classmates integration of JS in their classrooms.
