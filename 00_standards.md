## Computational Thinking

### *Modeling & Simulaton* 

### 9-12.CT.1
Create a simple digital
model that makes
predictions of outcomes.

I would teach how to make a linear regression model in a programming languge to predict the batting average of a baseball player given the previous 4 seasons. [click here](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/reg_assignments-SAYbaw/blob/main/FinalProjectSabaughSpring22/AWK_LessonPlan.pdf) to view the lesson plan. This Lesson would be an introduction to statistical modeling using one of the most most fundemntal prediction formulas used in in business, data sciene and machine learning, the latter two being hot topics in CS currently. I would them make a simple assignment showing them how to use the same program with some tweaks to predict populations. This lesson would be an exciting way to show the power of computers to make predictions for those who have not had experience with statistics in math courses and introduce them to more exciting modeling concepts.

### *Abstraction & Decomposition*
### 9-12.CT.4
Implement a program
using a combination of
student-defined and
third-party functions to
organize the
computation.

I would have the students write a bank account program using the OOP paradigm with a keen focus on abstraction and using built-in methods and user-defined methods in their class definition. They will use built-in methods to store data and retrieve data. Also, the abstraction concepts of method overriding will be enforced as students will need to override the built-in toString() method to hide their data.
