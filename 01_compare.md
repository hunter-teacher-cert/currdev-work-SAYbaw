# Compare
## *Beauty & Joy of Computing vs CodeHS with python*
### Major differences
CodeHS stays really close to the APCSA framework. The curriculum is laid out the same way as College Board. Code HS is also text based using Python (although there is a version that also uses JS). CodeHS also comes with an accompanying, online text-book. The hadware lessons are really great and better than BJC. BJC is better with the digital citzenship as far as lessons. Code HS appears to be a fully developed, all-in-one, one-stop-shop for a complete class, where BJC isn't as complete.

### Major similiarities
Both are very child like to me. They both use an animal sprites in their graphical online editor. They both use games to tech basic programming fundementals.

### Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
I have a bias against block based programming, so I will say that Code HS has the advantage over BJC in programming, however, I only have access to the syllabus and text book.

### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
I currently do not teach, but I would be interested in using the textbook. I want to find a good, well written textbook that explains things in English instead of my jargonese. I would also use the syllabus.
