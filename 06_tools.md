# Tools

I am not currently teaching, but thease would be my dream tools.

    tool
## OSX Macintosh Computers

    General purpose
For UNIX enviroment and general destop enviroment
    
    The class(es) you use it in.
All CS and Robotics classes except classes specifically for MS .net framework
    
    How you use it in class.
Mostly from the terminal, command line. I would also use a standard productivity suite such as office, libre Office, Google, iCloud or the like. I would use all GUI platforms and IDEs as necessary in the desktop enviroment.
    
    Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
I think that learning CS in a UNIX enviroment is so important. Also, OSX, in my opinion is the best version of UNIX/Linux out there and there is enough software available for OSX that desktop application would not be an issue, aslo some students may be familiar with apple products, and it would be an added bonus to teach them how to be power Mac users by using the backend of terminal.

    Tool
## Microsoft's Visual Studio

    General purpose
Any class involving a language using MS .net framework (e.g., C#, vb.net, Visual C++). Especially good for a class focusing on making GUI apps

    The class(es) you use it in.
Any CS class ranging from intro to CS to advance programming.

    How you use it in class.
Although it is just as a good an IDE for console apps as any other IDE, it is especially good at being an easy to use, intuititive WYSIWYG GUI enviroment for doing apps based around a simple window form. 

    Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
It is the fastest way to make real GUI apps using a professional IDE that I have tried. It is a practical skill that the students can use in the college or on the Job, and its an easier learning curve for the teacher too. I do not like Windows, but VS has been a solid IDE for about 20 years and they got this one right.
