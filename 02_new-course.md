# New Course
## Computing Systems

This class would be based on the amazing book and companion website [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principals](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). The class would allow students to see the overall picture of how a computer works by building one from scratch using simulation software. The students would receive hands-on knowledge of hardware architechture, operating systems, programming languages (low, mid and high), compilers data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and digital electronics. From nand to tetris.

1. Boolean Logic & Arithmetic 
2. Sequential logic
3. Machine Language
4. Computer Architechure
5. Assembler
6. Stack Arithmetic
7. Program Control
8. Compilers: Syntax Analsis and Code Generation
9. Operating System
10. App Development (Tetris Game)

I would also use source material from the book and companion website [How Computers Do Math](https://www.clivemaxfield.com/diycalculator/)

The target audience for this class is for students interested in studying engineering, electronics, or computer science in college. Also, it would be a fun class for the computer hobbyist.

It is more than a survey type class and is a more of a hands-on lab intensive class so it would be ideal taken as an elective in the student's senior year. They should tak at least one of the AP CS Courses prior.

NOTE: You know this would be a killer idea for a class at Stuy. If this idea inspires you, please allow me to consult ;)
