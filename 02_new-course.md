# New Course
## Computing Systems

This class would be based on the amazing book and companion website [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principals](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). The class would allow students to see the overall picture of how a computer works by building one from scratch using simulation software. The students would receive hands-on knowledge of hardware architechture, operating systems, programming languages (low, mid and high), compilers data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and digital electronics. From nand to tetris.

1. Boolean Logic & Arithmetic 
2. Sequential logic
3. Machine Language
4. Computer Architechure
5. Assembler
6. Stack Arithmetic
7. Program Control
8. Compilers: Syntax Analsis and Code Generation
9. Operating System
10. App Development (Tetris Game)

The target audience for this class is for students interested in studying engineering, electronics, or computer science in college. Also, it would be a fun class for the computer hobbyist.

It is more than a survey type class and is a more of a hands-on lab intensive class so it would be ideal taken as an elective in the student's senior year.
